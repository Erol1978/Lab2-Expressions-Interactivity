Result 1:
Output: Result 1: 2
This is not 2.4 because both numbers are integers, so C++ does integer division and removes the decimal.

Result 2:
Output: Result 2: 2
The % operator gives the remainder of a division. 12 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2.

Result 3:
Output: Result 3: 3.33333
This happens because x and y are doubles, so the division keeps the decimal value.

Result 4:
Output: Result 4: 6.33333
The sum of a, b, and c is divided by a double value, so the result is a decimal number.

Result 5:
Output: Result 5: 2.4
static_cast converts b to a double, so the division is done using decimals instead of integers.
